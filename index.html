        <h2>About Prince</h2>
            
            <p>Prince exploded on the scene and there have been few artists capable of creating a body of work as rich and varied. During the '80s, he emerged as one of the greatest talents of the rock & roll era, capable of seamlessly tying together multiple different styles of music such as pop, funk, folk, and rock. He released a series of groundbreaking albums while constantly touring, produced albums, wrote songs for many other artists, and recorded hundreds of songs that remain unreleased in his vaults.
    </p>
            <p>Prince frequently experimented with his music in ways that other contemporary artists would not do and was able to blend many diverse styles into a cohesive whole.  Each album released demonstrated a remarkable stylistic growth and musical diversity as a result of his experimenting with different sounds.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_(musician)">Click here to learn more about Prince</a>

    <br> 

        <h3>"Creep" performance from Coachella</h3>
            <p>This is one of my favorite live performances, even though it is not his song it demonstrates how he could take something and put his own spin on it.
